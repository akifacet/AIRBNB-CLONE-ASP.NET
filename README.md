The AIRBNB CLONE application developed using ASP.NET and .NET Framework includes HTML, CSS, and C#. Users select their preferred room type and then specify check-in and check-out dates. Simultaneously, they indicate whether they are students. When the user clicks the "Complete Reservation" button, the system automatically displays the total price.

The types of accommodations have specific discounts based on the duration of stay, and these discounts are communicated to the user in advance. The discount rate for students is 50 percent. Additionally, on the contact page, there is a WhatsApp link through which the user can contact.

The application also generates custom error messages for incorrect dates and invalid selections, assisting the user in understanding where they made a mistake.
